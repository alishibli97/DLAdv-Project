In this project, we present our re-implementation of the paper [Getting a CLUE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06848) on uncertainty estimations in tensorflow.


More experiments and the weights can be found on the [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GfaghgYgAWPl-ruWOAmws3jhHOVA88Jo?fbclid=IwAR21YAdvXZJJPGwQOlNdzFKbblujv-vqoI4asK18t19nyBF2VBv9u1suq2E).
